I am a Research Associate at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics of University of Strathclyde.
I am an applied mathematician with expertise at the interface of scientific computing, applied analysis and mathematical modelling. My research focuses on the mathematics of nematic liquid crystal (NLC) and partially ordered materials. She focuses on three essential problems - (I) NLC equilibria with emphasis on complex geometries of confinement and boundary conditions; (II) non-equilibrium phenomena e.g. switching processes and transition pathways; (III) modeling of complex biological LC systems e.g. membrane and the mixture of bacteria, elongated virus particles and polymers. My collaborators and I used delicate methods from complex analysis, Ginzburg-Landau theory and variational methods to study equilibria of NLC confined in thin geometries such as polygon and rectangle within powerful Landau-de Gennes theory, to study the effect of confinement on the multiplicity, spatial profiles of equilibria and their stable defects. We systematically investigated the switching mechanism and high-index saddle point nematics solution by using the multiscale string method and high-index optimization-based shrinking dimer method. We also developed a molecularly-informed phase field model motivated by the Ohta-Kawasaki model to study the membrane fusion, and studied the drug resistance of P. aeruginosa by investigating the interaction of nematic tactoids with bacteria.
